# SUEAPP
Used Android Studio and Android Maps SDK to create a KML (Keyhole Markup Language) overlay of subsurface utilities on Google Maps.  The app displays relevant information about the subsurface utilities (like, underground pipes) present on a path including their exact location and its distance from a static landmark.
